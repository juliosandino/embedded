# Embedded Software Engineering Learning Repository

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to my journey into the world of embedded software engineering. I am using the book **"Bare-Metal Embedded C Programming" by Israel Gbati** as my primary guide and reference.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to document my learning process, experiments, and projects as I explore embedded C programming concepts and techniques. All code, notes, and resources here are for educational purposes.

## What to Expect

- Code examples and exercises from the book
- Personal notes and explanations
- Experimentation with embedded systems concepts

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to Israel Gbati for the excellent resource that is "Bare-Metal Embedded C Programming".
